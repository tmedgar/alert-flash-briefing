# nps-flash-briefing
PHP code that calls the National Park Service (NPS) API, consumes alert data for a park, and outputs that data in JSON that is properly formatted for use by Alexa flash briefings. Parks are selected by passing in a single URL variable (e.g., ?park=acad). URL variable must be a valid alphacode for a national park site.
For more information about the NPS API, visit https://developer.nps.gov/api/index.htm.
